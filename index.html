    <h3>Calm down. Have a beer and take a seat, it'll be here once its done.
        You know, I'm probably sipping on a beer right now as I code this for you to see.
        I hope that isn't against the rules of online class...
        Even if it was (which it isn't) who cares? I'm in the comfort of my own home working
        on this project for my COSC 101 course and, to be honest, it isn't ready yet. Therefore,
        that is why you must look at this screen. Its pretty nice for a 'Coming Soon' page if I must
        say so myself - which I do, since I'm writing this. Honestly, I should probably keep working
        on the website, but my fingers hurt and thinking of ways to help elderly people use tech is getting
        repetitive. Oh shit - you're still here? Leave already, the website isn't done!</h3>
